On my honor:

-	I have not discussed the C language code in my program with
	anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
	assigned to this course.
-	I have not used C language code obtained from another student,
	or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
-	If any C language code or documentation used in my program
	was obtained from another source, such as a text book or course
	notes, that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in
	the comments of my program.

	Elmer Landaverde
